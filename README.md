# 🚀 Production-Ready RAG Data Platform on Azure Fabric

## Overview

This repository is a **reference implementation** for building a **production-ready, AI-ready data platform** on **Azure Fabric** using **PySpark and dbt**.

The goal is to demonstrate **how to prepare trustworthy data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — with a focus on **reliability, performance, governance, and cost awareness**, not demos or UI applications.

This project is intentionally **platform-aligned with Azure Fabric**, while keeping the core **Spark and lakehouse patterns portable** to Databricks.

## Who This Is For

This project is intended for:

- Data Engineers and Analytics Engineers  
- Azure / Fabric practitioners  
- Teams operating in **regulated or risk-aware environments**  
- Engineers looking to operationalise AI, not experiment with it  

---

## What Problem This Solves

Many AI / RAG examples focus on:
- toy datasets  
- notebooks without structure  
- missing data quality checks  
- no monitoring or auditability  

This project shows how to:

- ingest raw data into a lakehouse  
- clean and validate it using Spark and dbt  
- prepare AI-ready datasets  
- implement a basic RAG backend  
- add logging, cost tracking, and governance controls

- A foundation for **enterprise-grade AI data pipelines**  

### ❌ This project **IS NOT**
- A chat UI or application  
- A healthcare-specific implementation  
- A Copilot or prompt-engineering demo  
- A machine learning research project

## Design Principles

- **Production first**: every component should be operable, observable, and explainable  
- **Spark-native**: scalable transformations, not Pandas-style shortcuts  
- **AI-safe**: validated inputs, logged outputs  
- **Platform-aware**: Fabric-first, but Spark-portable  
- **Public-data only**: no proprietary or sensitive datasets  

---

## Current Status

🚧 **Work in progress**

This repository is being built incrementally as a learning-through-practice project.

## Disclaimer

This project uses **only public or synthetic data** and is intended for **educational and reference purposes**.  
It does not represent any specific organisation, healthcare system, or production environment.
